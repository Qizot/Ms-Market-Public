# MS Market Frontend

MS Market mobile application.

## How to make it work
In order to start the application you will need to setup your backend (you can lookup how to do it in backend directory).

The second thing is to obtain valid google's maps API KEY and place it in a proper folder (it has only been tested for android, to make it work for IOS please check proper google maps flutter's library documentation).

And the most important:
* place your DSNET'S client id in main.dart file in `DSNetApiConfig` init function.

Don' forget to include your backend ip as well (make sure you are on the same network as your backend unless having hosted backend app).
