# Ms Market Image server API

This is an implementation of image server written in go language.
To properly run the server you will need an access to the same database that 
graphql server has created, for more info see graphql server readme.

To run this server all you need is golang installed, but first you might want
to  specify images directory in .env file.

If config file is set propery you can start server by running:

    go run main.go
<br>
<br>
Server has only one endpoint:

    /images/{image id} GET POST DELETE

## Authorization  
*POST* and *DELETE* method require bearer token generated by graphql api

*GET* requests require no authorization

## Image manipulation
The server is using **pierrre**'s package which you can find at `https://github.com/pierrre/imageserver`, therefore all images upload and images requests can be manipulated via query params, when you want to resize an image. You might want to add another plugin, you can do it by placing it in `handlers.go` file. For more info please visit mentioned package documentation.
